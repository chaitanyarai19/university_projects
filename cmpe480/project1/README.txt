This program is written in python2 language and you can simply run it from terminal with giving two parameters first one for python file and second one for input file.

Example: 
> python search.py data/test/labyrinth/labyrinth_test_1.txt 

You should see an output like this on the terminal:

> Output files are created under search.py path.

After that output, files are created on that specific folder path which has the same path as search.py
