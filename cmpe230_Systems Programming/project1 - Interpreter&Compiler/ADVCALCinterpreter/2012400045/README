I have done the first part of the project. But i couldn't able to write makeFile for java.
I tried to copy and arrange what you did on java Makefile but i couldn't run from the terminal as you said. 
But you can run the program from terminal typing "java ADVCALC". Thank you for understanding.
 


In this project we were suppose to write an interpreter and i started to do it with infix to postfix and with one method which 
return the result by getting the postfix. 
In main method, take the input, if it has equal sign create a varible and equal 
it with the result come from the method. If no equal sing just print the variable.
