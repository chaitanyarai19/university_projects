<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   In this project, you are expected to develop the game detailed below.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Description</h3>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >You are expected to implement a game called &#8221;Sprinter Turtle&#8221;. In the Sprinter Turtle game, the user
controls a turtle by using arrow keys on the keyboard. The aim of the user is to get the turtle
across the street over and over again, during that time, keep the turtle from getting hit by a
car.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The game starts with the turtle sitting in the safe zone.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The vehicles are not controllable by the user. They travel within their own lanes. Furthermore,
      their creation, types, lanes and directions are decided randomly.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The user controls the turtle using arrow keys. The turtle can move forward, backward, to its
      right and left.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">In every round that turtle completes, vehicles get faster. This means that starting from the safe
      zone, when turtle reaches across the street and comes back to the safe zone, vehicle instances
      will be moved with an increased margin.
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Whenever the turtle gets hit by a vehicle, the game finishes and the final score is calculated.
      The score is calculated based on the number of rounds that the user completes. Faster rounds
      must be more rewarding in terms of score.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  leaderboard  will  keep  the  10  highest  scores.  This  requires  you  to  get  the  user  name
      before the game starts and keep the names and corresponding highest scores in a file that gets
      updated whenever a new high score is achieved.</li></ul>

<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >In the source code that is provided to you, there are two packages: visualization and runnable.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The package visualization contains one abstract class <span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-120">Vehicle </span>and an interface <span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-120">BoardIntf</span>. You are
      expected to design and implement:
           <ol  class="enumerate1" >
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2002x1">The <span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-120">Board </span>class, that implements the provided interface and serves as the board for the
           game, just as we did in PS5.
           </li>
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2004x2"><span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-120">Car </span>and <span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-120">Bus </span>classes, that must extend the provided abstract class. The instances of
           these classes will differ in size, color, and number of wheels they have.</li></ol>
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The package runnable contains <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-120">Main.java </span>and as usual, Main class contains the controller
      methods.
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">You are provided with the main loop of the game. Every iteration of this loop should
           be considered as a frame in your game. Therefore, in each frame you need to control
           vehicles, check for collisions, etc. In addition, if the game should proceed, then you
           need to update the objects, accordingly. Your main loop may look like as follows:

 id="x1-30003"></a>Bonus</h3>
<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Fully implemented, thoroughly tested and nicely documented additional features will receive bonus points.
These features include:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span class="underline">Implementing the &#8221;Fire!&#8221; feature:</span> This feature enables the turtle to fire its gun to eliminate
      a car using &#8221;WASD&#8221; keys. The turtle may use its fire ability only 3 times during a game.
      For example, when the user hits D key on the keyboard, the car to the right of the turtle gets
      demolished, and a new car gets created from the starting position of the lane. An example
      screen shot is given in the following figure.</li></ul>

</div>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span class="underline">Implementing the &#8221;Meteor Hit&#8221; functionality:</span> From time to time, a meteorite falls onto the
      road. The location that the meteorite will hit should be decided randomly. In order to enhance
      the gameplay, the users must be alerted 5 seconds before the meteorite hits. Therefore, you
      are expected to paint a bright yellow dot on the screen where the meteorite will hit within
      the following 5 seconds. Every object, vehicles and turtle, within a radius of 10 units will
      disappear; so that, if the turtle gets hit, then the game finishes and if the vehicles get hit, they
      just explode and the game continues.</li></ul>

      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">You   are   going   to   use   ACM&#8217;s   JTF   Graphics   library.   A   nice   way   to   study   the
      functionalities   that   this   library   provides   might   be   to   follow   the   tutorials   here
      http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">An initial implementation of the project is given at the end of the fifth PS. Use that code as
      your guide when building on top of the code we provide here.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Pay  attention  to  your  indentation  and  and  documentation  of  the  source  code.  Write
      corresponding test methods.</li></ul>
