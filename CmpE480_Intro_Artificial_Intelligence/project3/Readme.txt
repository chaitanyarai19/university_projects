This project is for learning deep neural networks and written in python3 language through ipython with using tensor flow. To be able to run this network do the following steps.

1) Install tensorflow on your computer (the easiest option is using a docker image on a linux operating system ​https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker​). Learn how to save your changes as docker images to continue later. Else you may lose your changes. If your computer has a powerful GPU, you may use a GPU supported docker image.

2) Complete the tutorial on Fashion MNIST dataset using tensorflow and keras libraries as shown: ​https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification
